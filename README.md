# CANCER-PREDICTION-NAIVEBAYES-KNN
This project focuses on predicting cancer levels using machine learning. It utilizes K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes classifiers. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, and the KNN model undergoes hyperparameter tuning to improve performance. Overall, the project aims to provide an accurate and efficient method for cancer prediction.

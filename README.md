# CANCER-PREDICTION-NAIVEBAYES-KNN
This project aims to predict cancer levels using machine learning algorithms, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes classifiers. The dataset contains features related to patients' characteristics, such as age, smoking habits, and chest pain, with the target variable indicating the level of cancer (high or low). 

The project involves data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Subsequently, the dataset is split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation. Both KNN and Naive Bayes classifiers are applied to predict cancer levels, and their performances are compared using accuracy metrics, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

Additionally, the KNN model is further optimized through hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to enhance its predictive performance. The project concludes with insights into the effectiveness of both algorithms in predicting cancer levels and the impact of model tuning on the KNN model's accuracy.
